# Custom script for reddit place event

Custom script I've been using during the reddit place event. I did it because I found funny to automatize the process.

I'm the only one who used this script (this is why I publish it after the event).

All I do is to get the overlay from the French community, resizing it, focus on which part was the most attacked and use the [reddit-place-script-2022](https://github.com/rdeepak2002/reddit-place-script-2022) developed by the community.
